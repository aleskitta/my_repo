Who am I? Someone that's afraid to let go, uh
You decide, if you're ever gonna let me know (Yeah)
Suicide, if you ever try to let go, uh
I'm sad, I know, yeah
I'm sad, I know, yeah


Prolly need a psychiatrist, I can't buy no happiness
When you try me on a trial, you leave off with a sentence
My world is brighter without you, but it's dark without my blessings
Fuck a check, I need my respect, and you know it
