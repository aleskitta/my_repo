Prolly need a psychiatrist, I can't buy no happiness
When you try me on a trial, you leave off with a sentence
My world is brighter without you, but it's dark without my blessings
Fuck a check, I need my respect, and you know it

Yeah, I'm sad, I know, yeah
I'm sad, I know, yeah
I lost my brain, I'm numb, I can't feel nothin', yeah
